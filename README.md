## Basic Calculator Project

This project implements a simple, web-based calculator facilitated as part of the FNB App Academy program. 
It provides fundamental arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) through a straightforward user interface.

### üöÄ Features
**Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

**Clear Functionality:** An "AC" (All Clear) button to reset the calculator.

**Intuitive Input:** Digits are entered sequentially, and operations are performed with an equals button.

**Single Operation at a Time:** Designed for sequential two-operand calculations.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure and layout of the calculator interface.

CSS3: For styling the calculator to make it visually appealing (assumed, as no CSS was provided, but implied for a "neat" interface).

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): For implementing the calculator's core logic and interactivity.
